# 13.3-car-class-program
  Write a class named  Car  that has the following member variables:       •        yearModel .  An  int  that holds the car’s year model.       •        make .  A string that holds the make of the car.       •        speed .  An  int  that holds the car’s current speed.    In addition, the class should have the following constructor and other member functions.       •      Constructor.  The constructor should accept the car’s year model and make as arguments. These values should be assigned to the object’s  yearModel  and  make  member variables. The constructor should also assign 0 to the  speed  member variables.       •      Accessor.  Appropriate accessor functions to get the values stored in an object’s   yearModel ,  make , and  speed  member variables.       •        accelerate .  The  accelerate  function should add 5 to the  speed  member variable each time it is called.       •        brake .  The  brake  function should subtract 5 from the  speed  member variable each time it is called.       Demonstrate the class in a program that creates a  Car  object, and then calls the   accelerate  function five times. After each call to the  accelerate  function, get the current speed of the car and display it. Then, call the  brake  function five times. After each call to the  brake  function, get the current speed of the car and display it.
